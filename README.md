# GridWorld Planning with LTLf Formulas
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a planner that solves tasks in a grid-world environment using Linear Temporal Logic formulas (LTLf). The code represents grid-world domains, obstacles, states, and goals, and uses LTLf formulas to define temporal tasks.
