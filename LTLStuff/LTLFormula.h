/*
Documentation on using SPOT for LTLf formulas: 
https://spot.lre.epita.fr/tut12.html

General Approach:
1. Have Spot read the input LTLf formula as if it was LTL.
2. Rewrite this formula in a way that embeds the semantics of LTLf in LTL.
First, introduce a new atomic proposition alive that will be true initially,
but that will eventually become false forever. Then adjust all original LTL
operators so that they have to be satisfied during the alive part of the word.
For instance the formula (a U b) & Fc would be transformed into alive & (a U (alive & b)) & F(alive & c) & (alive U G!alive).
3. Convert the resulting formula into a BÃ¼chi automaton
4. Remove the alive property, after marking as accepting all states with
an outgoing edge labeled by !alive.
(Note that since Spot does not actually support state-based acceptance,
it needs to keep a false self-loop on any accepting state without a successor
in order to mark it as accepting.)
5. Interpret the above automaton as finite automaton.
